An experiment to see how well github works for discussing, establishing, and maintaining order for a group of people. Inspired by clar shirky: http://www.ted.com/talks/clay_shirky_how_the_internet_will_one_day_transform_government

Have a general, non-personal, recurring issue? Go to "Issues" on the right, and create a new issue to propose a change to an existing rule, or a completely new one. General discussion can happen here for now too, including discussion about the experiment. You can also directly suggest edits to this document by clicking "README.txt" in the file list above, and clicking "edit" (you'll need a github account for this). An edit suggestion creates a new issue, so feel free to suggest and discuss. (and further change your suggestion, continue discussing, change, discuss, etc..)

Any hard and fast rules need to have an agreed upon enforcement method. In reality, a law is only a law if it's well enforced, otherwise it could be considered a lesser 'rule' that can be used as grounds for enforcement? Please don't poop near my stuff, otherwise I might need a bat to enforce some common sense. I'm kidding. But seriously don't do that.

In lieu of defining a specific group of people, say a set of roommates, people of a city, let's focus on first establishing the most general rules for people, the unspoken and assumed, laws that . Concrete, complete, but easily digestible definitions of simple things like "No stealing" which requires definitions of property, what can and cannot be property, and positive and negative consequnces for the occurence or absense of stealing. Definitions of exceptions like borrowing?

Next: After rules are agreed upon, write section explaining how they are 'accepted' and added to a list.
